# WW2 Weather Linear Regression

This project analyzes historical weather conditions during World War II using a linear regression model. The aim is to explore patterns and trends in the weather data and predict certain outcomes based on available features.

## Dataset

The dataset includes weather observations during World War II, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, and other relevant variables. The data has been cleaned and preprocessed for analysis.

## Project Structure

- `WW2_weather_regression.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis, data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
- `data/` — (Optional) Folder for the dataset if included.
- `README.md` — Project overview and instructions.

## Methodology

1. **Data Exploration:** Understanding distributions, missing values, and correlations between features.
2. **Preprocessing:** Cleaning, normalization, and handling missing data.
3. **Linear Regression Model:** Training a model to predict the target variable based on relevant features.
4. **Evaluation:** Measuring model performance using metrics such as R², MAE, and MSE.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/ww2-weather-regression.git
    ```
2. Navigate into the folder:
    ```bash
    cd ww2-weather-regression
    ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook WW2_weather_regression.ipynb
    ```

## Results

The model provides insights into how weather conditions varied during WWII and demonstrates the ability of linear regression to predict weather-related outcomes based on historical data.
